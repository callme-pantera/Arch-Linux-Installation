Arch Linux is one of the most well-known free and open-source Linux distributions in the IT community. It’s highly regarded for its extreme customizability, minimalism, and the level of control it gives the user over every aspect of the operating system. Guided by the [**KISS**](<comprehensive breakdown/KISS.md>) (*Keep It Simple, Stupid*) philosophy, Arch provides a clean, minimal base system without unnecessary additions, allowing the user to decide exactly what to install and how to configure it.<br>

Arch follows a **rolling release model**, meaning it is continuously updated rather than released in fixed versions. This ensures that users always have access to the latest software, but also requires them to manage updates carefully to maintain system stability. Software installation and management is handled through **pacman**, Arch’s lightweight yet powerful package manager, combined with the extensive **Arch User Repository (AUR)** for community-maintained packages.<br>

This level of freedom comes at a cost; Arch Linux is notoriously difficult to learn, especially for newcomers to Linux. The installation process is almost entirely manual, starting from a minimal base and requiring the user to assemble their system piece by piece. While there is an “easy install” option available, this documentation focuses on the **manual installation** method.<br>

If you want to refer to the official Arch Linux installation guide, you can find it [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) on their website.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This documentation is not intended to be a full step-by-step guide, but rather a reflection of my own work and process. Some prior IT knowledge may be necessary to fully understand certain sections. That said, I’ve tried to keep it reasonably clear so that even someone with limited experience can follow the general idea.
