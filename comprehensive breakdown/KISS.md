# KISS - *Keep It Simple, Stupid*
The **KISS principle** (*Keep It Simple, Stupid*) is one of the core philosophies behind Arch Linux. It does not mean “simple” in the sense of being beginner-friendly. Instead, it means that the system should remain as minimal and straightforward as possible under the hood, without unnecessary complexity or bloat.<br>

In Arch Linux, KISS translates to:

* Providing a minimal base system that you can build upon.
* Avoiding pre-installed software you may never use.
* Maintaining a transparent and predictable structure where you know exactly what is running on your machine.
* Giving full control to the user to decide what gets installed, configured, or removed.

This philosophy is the reason why Arch Linux does not have a flashy installer, preconfigured desktop environments, or layers of abstraction hiding what’s going on. Instead, you get the essential building blocks and you assemble the rest according to your needs.<br>

## Why it matters for this project
In this repository, every step, configuration choice, and customization follows the KISS principle. By starting from a bare minimum, we avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure that every package, service, and setting serves a clear purpose. This approach not only keeps the system lightweight but also makes it easier to maintain, troubleshoot, and adapt over time.<br>

> [!NOTE]
> KISS in Arch Linux means clarity, control, and minimalism — not hand-holding.
